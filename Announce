The Storage package is Tcl extension that adds a 'storage' command to
Tcl and provides access to Microsoft's "Structured Storage" file
format.  Structured storages are used extensively to provide
persistence for OLE or COM components. The format presents a
filesystem-like hierarchy of storages and streams that maps well into
Tcl's virtual filesystem model.

Notable users of structured storages are Microsoft Word and Excel.

See http://www.patthoyts.tk/index.html#tclstorage for files and
documentation.

Usage:
  storage open filename mode
     mode is as per the Tcl open command "[raw]+?"
     returns a storage command. The storage will remain open
     as long as the command exists. You can close the storage file
     using either the close subcommand or renaming the command.
  eg: % storage open document.doc r+
      stg1

 object commands:
  opendir name ?mode?     open or create a sub-storage
  open name ?mode?        open or create a stream as a Tcl channel
  close                   close the storage or sub-storage
  stat name varname       get information about the named item
  commit                  not used
  rename oldname newname  rename a stream or sub-storage
  remove name             deletes a stream or sub-storage + contents

  propertyset open name ?mode?  open a property set
  propertyset delete name       delete a property set
